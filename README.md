Selenium-Maven-Template
=======================

1. Open a terminal window/command prompt
2. Clone this project.
3. `cd Selenium-Maven-Template-master` (Or whatever folder you cloned it into)
4. `mvn clean verify`

All dependencies should now be downloaded and the example google cheese test will have run successfully in headless mode (Assuming you have Firefox installed in the default
location)
